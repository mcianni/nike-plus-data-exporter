NikePlus Data Exporter
=======================

This is a simple Sinatra app providing a web interface to my [NikePlus
exporter library](https://github.com/mcianni/nikeplus_to_csv).

[NikePlus](http://nikeplus.nike.com) is an exercise tracking app that utilizes the GPS ability of
your iOS device to record various data. 

This app gives you the ability to export your exercise data to a CSV
file that can be imported into the spreadsheet program of your choice.

You can try out a demo of this app [on heroku](http://nike-plus-data-exporter.heroku.com).
